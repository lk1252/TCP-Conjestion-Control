#PROBLEM STATEMENT

Compare TCP congestion control algorithms and look at how virtualization helps in this regard.


Our problem statement focuses on seeing which algorithm is a better fit among four given TCP Congestion control algorithms. Its to be noted that all four of these algorithms are used as default in various versions of Linux kernel.


We also look into how virtualization helps in congestion controls by providing a test bed which if done with hardware setup ensures speed but costs a lot to implement.


Topology for the virtual network
We create a virtualized network topology using the mininet. This topology file consists of various hosts, switches and routers. This topology will be used by the mininet to form a virtualized network of hosts.


Various python libraries to help visualize and compute
We take help of various python libraries to visualize or help with calculating the various networking parameters in a network.


Main Program
The main python program shall compile the topology from our topology module. It will then proceed to use the mininet library to generate hosts and switches. We will be making various configurations for each host that can act as an individual system and has its own terminal interface.


We will then transmit information between various hosts or ping them and calculate  the required networking parameters like bandwidth, throughput etc. to calculate the congestion.


Then we shall apply the four algorithms as discussed and compare them analytically.
 
# SCOPE

The use of network worldwide has increased extremely over the last few years, which now has created this congestion problem over the wide area network (WAN) and has also become more and more severe with the exponential rise with the users. So, to avoid congestion problem, there is a need of some congestion avoidance protocols. Basic TCP variants (i.e. TCP Reno and Tahoe) uses additive increase multiple decrease algorithm to adjust their window size. These TCP variants has been performed well when they are used over the local area network (LAN). So, at then there was a need of better protocols, which will lead us to the development of the TCP Vegas and FAST TCP. TCP Tahoe and Reno perform better at the low bandwidth-delay networks as we know the packet losses are less. To overcome this problem, TCP Vegas and FAST TCP are proposed which performed well over high speed internet link networks. Keywords TCIP/IP, WAN, LAN, FAST TCP.
The scope of this project only applies to specific types of topography which we will be defining. There might be some cases where a particular topology gives a better performance for an algorithm than the other. We will be taking a simple topography for that reason.
TCP endpoints were separated by an virtualization layer and subjected to the intervention of the hypervisor's scheduling.
