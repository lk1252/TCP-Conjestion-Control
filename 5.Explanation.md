CODE EXPLANATION:

First we will discuss the dumbbell topology used in our code. The dumbbell topology consists of two switches connected by a link, with four hosts at each end. Four hosts each send to the opposite side. We see throughput variation in the TCP ﬂows, due to ACKs of a ﬂow in one direction contending for the queue with the reverse ﬂow, increasing ACK delivery delay variability.

s1	s2

s3	s4
/\	/\ h1 h3 h2

s1 and s2 form the backbone routers and s3 and s4 act as the access routers. There are four hosts named from h1 to h4 respectively.

Firstly we will install various requirements that re specified in the requirements.txt file. These files are used to process the data.

Next we shall import various packages for ease of use to make the code much simpler. We also install the mininet package for enabling network virtualization.
In the code we define the dumbbell topology class. This class specifies the various switches, routers and links required.

The class contains a single method to process these.
The build method helps to define parameters like bandwidth, delay and max queue size and apply these on various switches which are then added along with hosts and links. A dumbbell_test() function tests this network.


The function clean_tcpprobe_procs() searches and kills any running tcpprobe processes in the network.
 
The function draw_cwnd_plot() takes in parameters to plot cwnd vs time plot for the host passed as argument. Similarly the function draw_fairness_plot() plots the fairness plot for the iperf client hosts.
For a given algorithm, the parse_iperf_data() parses the iperf data files for it. For the tcp algorithms we have a set of functions defined to help with.
The parse_tcpprobe_data() parses the tcp probe data for given algorithms. Start_tcpprobe() installs tcp probe modules required and dumps them into a file.

We define a helper function to test the tcp algorithms are working or not. The main method parses command line arguments to help a user to easily choose their configuration and test the network accordingly.
