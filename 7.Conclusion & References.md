#Conclusion

Learning about TCP congestion and TCP congestion control Algorithms like Reno, BIC, CUBIC, H-TCP demonstrates importance of TCP and congestion control in transmitting data over a network. Going through various fields of applications, we observe how different TCP congestion algorithms are designed for different kind of data streaming and internet protocol like video streaming, buffer transfer over HTTP/2 and high-speed private networks exiting in the cloud, thus we can conclude how significant it is to understand and choose the right congestion algorithm for optimized performance of Transferring data.

TCP is an integral part of cloud native offerings and services like k8s, Load Balancers and ingress controllers paired with web proxies like NGINX, HA PROXY, TRAEFIK etc. All these technologies run container application inside a private network and use Linux technologies to manipulate DNS over TCP thus providing a robust way of communication inside private networks.

Studying about TCP and its congestion control algorithms provided us with insight about  how network virtualization happens in these container-based technologies. We also learned about creating our own VPC with a defined CIDR range, public and private subnets, Internet Gateway for outside discovery, Routing Tables for connecting Internet Gateway to subnets.

All this provided us a greater understanding about network virtualization
